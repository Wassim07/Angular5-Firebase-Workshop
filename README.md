# Getting Started
You have to follow this process everytime you want to run one of these projects (only the first time):

- change environment.ts' firebase value with your own credentials
- open cmd at the root of a project and type "npm install" in order to install required packages (you'll notice the creation of a folder called "node modles")
- type "ng serve --open"
